# Lungs Consolidation detection by AttenionNet

Our Model detects whether the X-ray image is of  patient diagnosed by Pneumonia having a Consolidated lung or a healthy person with Normal lung. 

We have analyzed our data on 2 different models one with Efficient Net and other by applying attention over Efficient Net. 

# Dataset Description
Our dataset contains two classes namely Consolidation and Normal which in total contains 2043 images .
Consolidation class has 1016 images.
Normal class has total 1027 images.


# Advantage of using Attention

Earlier Model without using Attention had accuracy of approx 49% but after using Attention accuracy significantly jumped to approx 65%.
